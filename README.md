@@ Why use CryptoQuail for your programs? @@

+ CryptoQuail encryption generates short ciphertexts, while some block ciphers generate ciphertexts way longer than the plaintext.
+ CryptoQuail has most of the cryptography utils you need.
+ You don't have to type lots of code to run a function in one of the modules.
+ CryptoQuail ciphertexts are completely different when only one character of the key is changed. This is called the avalanche effect.

- Warning: If you encrypt a message with one programming language, you cannot decrypt it with another translation of CryptoQuail.
